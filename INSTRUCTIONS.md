## Upgrading to Open Source Firmware

It is now possible to reflash Sengled bulbs (at least the W31-N15 has been tested, which uses the Sengled WF863 module, itself containing an ESP8266EX chip) with open firmware such as [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/) (tested) and ESPHome (untested). The process to download an arbitrary firmware involves using a "shim" app known as Sengled-Rescue, which is located in the `sengled-ota` folder of the project. A compiled version of Sengled-Rescue is located in `shim.bin` of the main project.

Once you set up the workflow for one bulb, flashing additional bulbs should become a 5-minute job.

To flash firmware, you first need to reach "Phase 2" in MQTT mode above. **You need to be able to send MQTT commands through your broker using sengled_tool.py**. Once you are able to send on/off commands, you can send the `--upgrade shim.bin` command to reflash Sengled-Rescue and begin that workflow.

```
python sengled_tool.py --broker-ip 192.168.0.100 --mac E8:DB:8A:AA:BB:CC --upgrade "shim.bin"
[        ^-- This part comes from your successful WiFi setup -- ^      ] [^- Upgrade command]
```

Once you have flashed shim.bin successfully, you will see a "Sengled-Rescue" WiFi SSID on your network. Connect to it and open http://192.168.4.1 in your browser. From there, you will see whether it landed in "ota_0" (bad, cannot flash) or "ota_1" (good, can flash up to 1MB). Though the Flash chip in the bulb (WF863 module) is 2MB, the firmware you upload cannot "clobber" the running software (in ota_1) which begins a bit past 1MB - thus the size limitation. Uploading a firmware *.bin to "boot" completely transforms the software of the bulb, making it a basic/generic ESP8266 device.

After you've flashed your software, the bulb is now a standard ESP8266EX device, for all intents and purposes.

## Prerequisites

* Install Python 3.10+ and dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



* Install an MQTT broker ([Mosquitto download link](https://mosquitto.org/download/)) reachable from the bulb.
* Connect your computer to the bulb AP `Sengled_Wi‚ÄëFi Bulb_XXXXXX` before pairing.

## Broker setup (TLS required)

The bulb requires an MQTT broker that accepts TLS connections.

### Example broker: Mosquitto

1. Download and install Mosquitto from the [official site](https://mosquitto.org/download/).
2. Install OpenSSL ([Windows builds here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)).
3. Generate a self‚Äësigned TLS certificate:

```
### Windows
# Create a local CA
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" genrsa -out ca.key 2048
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" req -x509 -new -key ca.key -days 3650 -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=Local-CA"

# Create server key + CSR (use any descriptive CN, e.g., broker.local)
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" genrsa -out server.key 2048
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=broker.local"

# Sign server cert
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 3650 -sha256
```

```
### Linux/MacOS
# Create a local CA
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -key ca.key -days 3650 -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=Local-CA"

# Create server key + CSR (use any descriptive CN, e.g., broker.local)
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=broker.local"

# Sign server cert
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 3650 -sha256
```

4. Place your generated certificate and key files (`ca.crt`, `server.crt`, `server.key`) in the project root directory alongside the `mosquitto.conf` file, adjusting file names if you used different names during certificate generation.
5. Start Mosquitto with the bundled config:

   * Windows (PowerShell) ‚Äî run the terminal as Administrator and ideally `cd` to the project root first:

     ```
     "C:\Program Files\mosquitto\mosquitto.exe" -c .\mosquitto.conf -v
     ```
   * Linux/macOS:

     ```
     mosquitto -c ./mosquitto.conf -v
     ```

## Wi‚ÄëFi pairing (quick)

* Interactive:
  In interactive mode, the bulb will return a list of surrounding Wi‚ÄëFi networks (SSIDs) it detects. The script will prompt you to choose which network it should connect to, and you will need to provide the corresponding Wi‚ÄëFi password.
  **Note:** Replace `192.168.0.100` in the examples with the local IP address of the device running the broker (most likely your PC).

```
# If --broker-ip is omitted, the tool uses this PC's local IP automatically
python sengled_tool.py --setup-wifi
```

* Non‚Äëinteractive:

```
# If --broker-ip is omitted, the tool uses this PC's local IP automatically
python sengled_tool.py --setup-wifi --ssid "YourSSID" --password "YourWifiPassword"
```

The tool starts an embedded HTTP server, waits for the bulb to call `/life2/device/accessCloud.json` and `/jbalancer/new/bimqtt`, then (if it detects the bulb‚Äôs LAN IP) attempts a UDP ON/OFF test and prints follow‚Äëup command examples.

If ports 80/8080 are busy, the tool assumes you run your own HTTP server and will not wait for endpoint hits or run the UDP test.

## Control (MQTT) - [MQTT_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md](MQTT_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md)

**Note:** Replace `192.168.0.100` with the local IP of the broker host.

```
python sengled_tool.py --broker-ip 192.168.0.100 --mac E8:DB:8A:AA:BB:CC --on
python sengled_tool.py --broker-ip 192.168.0.100 --mac E8:DB:8A:AA:BB:CC --off
python sengled_tool.py --broker-ip 192.168.0.100 --mac E8:DB:8A:AA:BB:CC --brightness 50
python sengled_tool.py --broker-ip 192.168.0.100 --mac E8:DB:8A:AA:BB:CC --color 255 0 0
```

## Control (UDP) - [UDP_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md](UDP_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md)

```
python sengled_tool.py --ip 192.168.0.247 --udp-on
python sengled_tool.py --ip 192.168.0.247 --udp-off
```

## Notes

* TLS may be required by bulbs; use self‚Äësigned certs if necessary.
* **After power loss, the bulb may need to re‚Äëquery the HTTP endpoints. Make sure the broker is running. Once the bulb successfully contacts these endpoints, it will become responsive again because it retrieves the MQTT broker address from them. You can start the embedded HTTP server without re‚Äëpairing by running:**

```
python fake_sengled_server.py
```

**Note:** The server defaults to your PC's local IP; use `--broker-ip` if your broker is on another device or for troubleshooting.
